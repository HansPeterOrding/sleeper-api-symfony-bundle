### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report for SleeperApiSymfonyBundle. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports.

When you are creating a bug report, please [include as many details as possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-bug-report).

> **Note:** If you find a **Closed** issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). Create an issue on [the repository](https://github.com/HansPeterOrding/nflfastr-symfony-bundle) and provide the following information in your report.

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible. For example, start by explaining how you installed SleeperApiSymfonyBundle, which command exactly you used in the terminal, or what you did otherwise. When listing steps, **don't just say what you did, but explain how you did it**.
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).
* **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
* **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**
* **Include screenshots** which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem.

Provide more context by answering these questions:

* **Did the problem start happening recently** (e.g. after updating to a new version of SleeperApiSymfonyBundle) or was this always a problem?
* If the problem started happening recently, **can you reproduce the problem in an older version of SleeperApiSymfonyBundle?** What's the most recent version in which the problem doesn't happen?
* **Can you reliably reproduce the issue?** If not, provide details about how often the problem happens and under which conditions it normally happens.

Include details about your configuration and environment:

* **Which version of SleeperApiSymfonyBundle are you using?**
* **What's the name and version of the OS you're using**?
* **Are you running SleeperApiSymfonyBundle in a virtual machine?** If so, which VM software are you using and which operating systems and versions are used for the host and the guest?
* **Can you describe your project setup**? Which symfony version are you using? Which other componets are required? Which PHP version are you using?
