Introduction
============

This bundle was created, to enable coders in the Symfony bubble to work easily with the data provided by Sleeper API. Therefore, it introduces different [import strategies](import_strategies.md) that all create object oriented [entities](entities.md) where the data is [mapped](field_mapping.md)  in a very structured approach.

If you have not heard of Sleeper API so far, it is a good idea to take a closer look to the [project page](https://docs.sleeper.com/). This project provides data for fantasy leagues in the sleeper platform.
